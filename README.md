# EcoRangeEstimator.
 
Eco Range Estimator is an Android application developed using Kotlin in Android Studio, designed to help electric vehicle (EV) users estimate their driving range based on key input parameters. The app calculates the estimated range (in kilometers) by taking into account the vehicle's battery capacity (kWh) and energy efficiency (kWh/km), providing a simple yet practical tool for eco-conscious drivers.
